Bootscore combines [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and the [Underscores](https://underscores.me) theme boiler template in a compact starter theme for outstanding [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) projects. It does not include customizer settings, logo upload functionality, or drag-and-drop features. Customization in Bootscore is entirely achievable through its `.php`, `.scss`, and `.js` files, requiring basic coding skills for editing. 

The Bootstrap source code is included, allowing easy on-the-fly editing Bootstrap without the need for Gulp, Node, or any other technical commands. Simply add your styles, save, and let the built-in [scssphp](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp) compiler do the rest.

Bootscore comes with full [WooCommerce](https://woo.com/) support, featuring an integrated AJAX offcanvas cart.

This time-saving tool is designed to swiftly create clean, mobile-first projects. If you are familiar with Bootstrap and its HTML classes, you'll feel right at home and be able to build whatever you desire.
